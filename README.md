# Event Guest List Manager

**Goal**: The goal of this project is to help users manage attendees for events and track RSVPs in a simple, user-friendly interface.

**What is Markdown?**

According to the _Mastering Markdown GitHub Guide_, Markdown is:

> [A] way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like `#` or `*`.

We often use Markdown to write our READMEs for [GitHub](https://github.com/). A **README** is how we document our code, give specific instructions on how to run it, or describe any known issues.
